## Installation and Setup Instructions

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Reflection

This project was built by three members during our Unit 3 React Lesson. Our project goals included using technologies learned up to this point and practicing our dev skills along with working in a collaborative environment. 

This application is built upon :
-Two object models: User and Bookmark
-A full CRUD express API for bookmarks 
-A single-page built with React with ability for users to create and add new bookmarks to their own list 
-Adding the ability to see all bookmarks and delete bookmarks 

One of the main challenges we had was Authentication. Getting authentication working based off of user permission which asssociated the users to bookmarks.

The technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router 6.0, VanillaJS, JavaScript, StyledComponents, CSS,Authenitcation, dotenv, Mongoose, Netlify and Heroku.
